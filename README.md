# Self-Driving Car – Behavioral Cloning

This repository implements a behavioral cloning approach for autonomous driving
using the Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator.

## Project Overview
The system trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict steering angles
from camera images and controls the simulator vehicle via a Socket.IO server.

## Simulator
The Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator is **not included** in this repository
due to size constraints.
